Welcome to the Premier League Data Engineering project. I tackle the challenge of consuming data from multiple sites, processing it, pushing it to an S3 bucket, normalizing the data, and running analytics. 

# Sources

# Process description
1. Data Scraping: Developed a Python-based AWS Lambda function (scrape.py) to extract Premier League data from multiple sources.
3. Data Storage: The Lambda function categorizes and stores the scraped data in designated Amazon S3 buckets.
4. Athena Table: Transformed the stored data into Parquet format and created an Athena table for efficient SQL querying.
5. Data Analysis & Visualization: Leveraged Preset for interactive data analysis and visualization.
6. Automation & Scheduling: Integrated an EventBridge rule to automate the process, ensuring it runs every Saturday and Sunday until the season concludes.
